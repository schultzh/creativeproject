The social welfare system in China exists within the context of Confucianism:
where the idea of family loyalty is engrained into everyday life. This concept,
also known as filial piety, requires one to put their family first and take
care of them. Given that social welfare policy has been written under this context,
much of the duties fall to the family, rather than the governement, leaving
the ever growing elderly population in China at risk of falling through the cracks.
