In the most broad sense social welfare can be defined as
“organized public or private social services for the assistance
of disadvantaged groups” (Definition, 2021). However, depending on
a state’s cultural implications and government policies greatly
affects how that state chooses to conduct their social welfare policy.

Specifically, The People’s Republic of China social welfare system
could be better understood “as the three nos, “the government was responsible
only for taking care of. . .those who could not work, had no family support,
and had no other source of income” (Leung, China’s Social Welfare, Ch. 1).

## Who Does it Impact?

Following the broad definition of social welfare and China’s
understanding of social welfare with its three nos it only
affects those who are disadvantaged in the sense that they can’t
“work, had no family support, and had no other source of income”
(Leung, China’s Social Welfare, Ch. 1). 

However, Peter Whiteford’s TED talk  
[The  myth of ‘us’ and ‘them’ - why we all need the welfare state](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZU0zfA4E9I)
challenges the general definition of social welfare and China’s implementation of social welfare.
Social Welfare across many spectrums has come to represent support for those disadvantaged frequently in an economic sense.
However, in Whitford’s talk he disputes this ideology and contends that social welfare should be utilized to everyone because
of the shared experience of vulnerability every human being goes through.

The Social Welfare system within China is a constantly evolving system that is seeking to support the constantly-changing
needs of its people. However, disparities arise within China as the implementation of the 13th Five Year Plan varies
from urban to rural areas within China (Selden, 1658). Disparities are apparent in China’s current social welfare system,
the question of whether China’s current social welfare system is fair and equitable as China’s Hukuo seemingly only give
certain social welfare benefits based on their citizens location and age. Specifically, China’s proportion of elderly in China has
nearly tripled since the creation of The People’s Republic of China (China, 2018). 

Consequently, with the exponential growth of the elderly population in China by the early 2010s,
the social welfare system was no longer sufficient to support China’s elderly population. Therefore,
China sought to enact a social welfare system called the “13th Five-Year Plan (2016–2020) that explores
the possibilities of creating a long-term care insurance (LTCI) system” (Dai, 2019). An example of China’s
13th Five Year plan efforts would suggest actions like, “improving elderly care facilities by building nursing
homes for the elderly, helping provide combined medical and care services, developing better community daycare 
centers, and providing rehabilitation equipment” (The Peoples, 2017).
