## China’s social welfare and Confucian values?

As seen, China’s social welfare system is an institution that
has rules of its own. For example the Hukou status being a
person's welfare eligibility. This can be seen as problematic
in many ways because one must ask the questions of “who has what status and why?
Who’s getting welfare and who isn’t?” When looked at through a confucian lens it is
evident that China’s welfare legislation does not necessarily take into account the
confucian cultural values. 

## What does Confucianism say about social welfare?

The confucian perspective on welfare is based on the fundamental
values of their doctrine being filial piety and the hierarchical nature of relationships.
Filial piety is the “the attitude of obedience, devotion, and care
toward one's parents and elder family members”, showing respect and caring for the people
who have come before you. It is expected that members of this culture take care of their
elders when they are old, out of respect. The way the welfare system is legislated makes
it hard for that to be the case. Older people who do not work, rural hukou, aren't able to
get the help they need. And the young, working class urban hukou status people, who, by confucian
ethics, should be taking care of the elders, have access. 

## So, what now?

Confucian culture is still deeply entrenched in Chinese society. People still
live by and respect the values set forth. The government should reflect the values
of the people. So, in order to solve this problem with respect to confucian values
there would need to be some legislative change. Solutions could range from eradicating
the hukou system, allowing everyone to have an urban status, or even legislate confucian
values to ensure the safety and welfare of elder people.
